#  Mobile Sales Dashboard Project Using POWER BI

##  Project Overview  
This Mobile Sales Dashboard project is built using Power BI to give a clear and interactive view of mobile phone sales data. Itâ€™s made mainly for business users and decision-makers who want to track key metrics like revenue, profit, and sales trends across different regions, brands, and customer types. The dashboard has custom date filters and DAX-powered KPIs for dynamic, real-time insights.

##  Problem Statement  
The raw sales data was available in Excel format, but it was difficult for decision-makers to find meaningful trends, compare sales across regions and time periods, and analyze customer behavior. The goal was to transform this raw data into a structured, visual dashboard that makes analysis fast and intuitive.

##  Key KPIs Implemented
- Total Revenue  
- Total Profit  
- Total Quantity Sold  
- Monthly, Quarterly, and Yearly Sales Trends  
- Profit by Region  
- Sales by Brand and Product  
- Customer Type Distribution  
- Same Period Last Year (SPLY) Comparisons  

##  What I Have Done
1. Cleaned and prepared the raw Excel dataset.  
2. Created a custom date calendar using DAX.  
3. Built relationships between tables in the data model.  
4. Wrote DAX measures for MTD, QTD, YTD, and SPLY metrics.  
5. Designed an interactive dashboard using slicers, cards, bar charts, and line charts.  
6. Enabled edit interactions for visual-level interactivity.  
7. Published the dashboard to Power BI Service for easy access and sharing.

##  Results Achieved  
With the final dashboard, users can:
- Monitor sales performance on a monthly and yearly basis.  
- Quickly identify top-performing regions and brands.  
- Compare revenue and profit over time.  
- Understand the distribution of sales across different customer types.  
- Use SPLY and YTD to benchmark current performance.

##  Recommendations
1. Integrate live data for real-time sales monitoring.  
2. Add forecasting using Power BI time series models.  
3. Expand the model with marketing and customer feedback data.  
4. Use dashboard KPIs to guide regional sales strategy.  
5. Use filters to dive deeper into brand-wise or region-wise insights.
